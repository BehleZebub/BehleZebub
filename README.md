Hi, I’m @BehleZebub.

I like to work with microcontrollers, 
3D modeling and printing, lasercutters and 
then there is wood and metalwork, 
restauration of (old) 
hardware and that's why I work on way too 
many projects at once and now I try to 
manage them with github.

We'll see, if/how it works..
